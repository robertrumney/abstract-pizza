# Unity C# Pizza Example: Abstract Classes

This repository contains a simple Unity C# project demonstrating the use of abstract classes with the concept of pizza. The purpose of this educational resource is to help people understand the basics of abstract classes in Unity C# by using pizza examples, recipes, variations, and ingredients.

## Why Abstract Classes?

Abstract classes allow you to define a base class that cannot be instantiated but can be inherited by other classes. They provide a blueprint for creating multiple variations of a class without the need for duplicating code. In this example, we use pizzas to demonstrate how abstract classes can help organize different pizza types and their behavior while reusing common properties and methods from the base class.

## Example Overview

In this example, we have:

1. An abstract base class called `Pizza` that holds common properties and methods for different types of pizzas.
2. Concrete pizza classes (e.g., `MargheritaPizza` and `PepperoniPizza`) that inherit from the abstract `Pizza` class and provide their implementation of the `Prepare()` method.
3. A simple `PizzaStore` class that demonstrates how to create and interact with pizza objects.
